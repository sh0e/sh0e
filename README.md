Hello nerd! My name is *shoe*. Your small brain will not be able to comprehend the information that I am about to bestow upon you.

**Accomplishments:**

 • I have once coded 100 lines of pure HTML and CSS blindfolded dedicated to cats. (https://meow.cats-are-awesome.cf)
 
 • I drank an 8 oz cup of tea in 3 seconds. ☕
 
 • I printed 50 pages of random cat images in color for no apparent reason.
 
 • I am very tall *h*.

 **🏆 Extras:** *LoL*
 
 • My Discord account has been terminated on 3 different occasions for selfbot :D
 
 • I once listened to an automation of Irish Poetry for 30 minutes straight.
 
 
Despite my *very* unique talents I behold, I like to do a lot of Internal computing too. Mainly in C++, C#, Java, and Python. I do a lot of web development tests, and game plugins as well such as proxies (ShoeNet), and currently a Minecraft Chatbot in NodeJS.

Feel free to DM me on Discord with any questions. **- shoe#1327**
